 = Verification of computational models of cardiac electro-physiology = 

The project corresponds to the paper: Pras Pathmanathan and Richard A. Gray, ''Verification of computational models of 
cardiac electro-physiology'', accepted for publication in International Journal for Numerical Methods in Bioengineering.

Walk-throughs of the main tests are given below. The entire project, which includes all source files, results files and matlab scripts, can be viewed at 
[https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/browser/projects/CardiacEpVerification projects/CardiacEpVerification],

New users of Chaste who wish to install Chaste and run this project, see GettingStarted and ChasteGuides. 

 == Testing against exact solutions ==

This test compares the results of the cardiac electro-physiology solver in Chaste on model problems with exact solutions, for monodomain, bidomain and bidomain-with-bath,
and in 1D, 2D and 3D. See [PaperTutorials/CardiacEpVerification/EpAgainstExactSolutions EpAgainstExactSolutions]. 
A results file containing the raw results is included in the project (link above).

 == 1D conduction velocity ==

This test computes the conduction velocity in a 1D monodomain simulation using different mesh resolutions. A matlab script applies Richardson extrapolation
to the results. See [PaperTutorials/CardiacEpVerification/ConductionVelocityCaseStudy ConductionVelocityCaseStudy]. 
A results file containing the raw results is included in the project (link above), as is the matlab script.

 == Reentry on a 3D rabbit geometry  ==

The test uses an S1-S2 protocol to induce reentry on a rabbit geometry, and is set up to run on the full-resolution Oxford rabbit heart, as well
as medium and coarse resolution versions of the same geometry. See [PaperTutorials/CardiacEpVerification/ReentryOnRabbitMesh ReentryOnRabbitMesh]. 

To run this test you will need to download the meshes and provide their locations. The coarse mesh is already in the Chaste repository, so nothing
needs to be done for this. Also, it is possible run the coarse mesh simulation on a normal desktop or laptop. The fine mesh is available for download
at the main [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html download page] (`OxfordRabbitHeart_binary.tgz`). Simulations using this mesh will
probably require high-performance computing resources (the simulation for the paper on this mesh took 74 minutes using 256 processes). 
The medium and fine resolution meshes are both contained in the public data repository -- see https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/browser/data/public. 

'''Note:''' We have recently observed that these simulations can, when run on different hardware/software configurations but using the same mesh, 
look identical for (say) up to 500ms, but then begin to differ - presumably an example of tiny differences in a chaotic system building up
to large differences. This should be taken into account if you run any of the simulations and then compare with the figures in the paper. 
It may be possible to force these divergences to occur later by using much smaller tolerances; more investigation is required.  
These observations does not affect the conclusions of Section 3.2 in the paper, that anatomical detail (fine vs medium mesh) leads to large
differences in activation patterns (much earlier than 500ms) and overall that calculation verification for simulations involving such arrhythmic
activity appears is extremely difficult. When using such simulations it will be important to choose robust QOIs for which numerical 
error can be meaningfully estimated.
