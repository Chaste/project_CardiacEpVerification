 = Verification of computational models of cardiac electro-physiology = 

The project corresponds to the paper: Pras Pathmanathan and Richard A. Gray, ''Verification of computational models of 
cardiac electro-physiology'' (in submission). 

Walk-throughs of the main tests are given below. The entire project, which includes all source files, results files and matlab scripts, can be viewed at 
[https://chaste.cs.ox.ac.uk/trac/browser/projects/CardiacEpVerification projects/CardiacEpVerification],

For new users of Chaste who wish to install Chaste and run this project, see GettingStarted and ChasteGuides. 

 == Testing the electro-physiology solver against exact solutions ==

This test compares the results of the cardiac electro-physiology solver in Chaste on model problems with exact solutions, for monodomain, bidomain and bidomain-with-bath,
and in 1D, 2D and 3D. See [PaperTutorials/CardiacEpVerification/EpAgainstExactSolutions EpAgainstExactSolutions]. 
A results file containing the raw results is included in the project (link above).

 == 1D conduction velocity ==

This test computes the conduction velocity in a 1D monodomain simulation using different mesh resolutions. A matlab script applies Richardson extrapolation
to the results. See [PaperTutorials/CardiacEpVerification/ConductionVelocityCaseStudy ConductionVelocityCaseStudy]. 
A results file containing the raw results is included in the project (link above), as is the matlab script.

 == Reentry on a 3D rabbit geometry  ==

The test uses an S1-S2 protocol to induce reentry on a rabbit geometry, and is set up to run on the full-resolution Oxford rabbit heart, as well
as medium and coarse resolution versions of the same geometry. See [PaperTutorials/CardiacEpVerification/ReentryOnRabbitMesh ReentryOnRabbitMesh]. 

To run this test you will need to download the meshes and provide their locations. The coarse mesh is already in the Chaste repository, so nothing
needs to be done for this. Also, it should be fine to run the coarse mesh simulation on a normal desktop or laptop. The fine mesh is available for download
at the main [http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/download.html download page] (download `OxfordRabbitHeart_binary.tgz`). Simulations using this mesh will
probably require high-performance computing resources. The medium resolution mesh is currently not publicly available (though Oxford CS members please 
speak to a developer). This page will be updated when the medium-resolution mesh is available.
